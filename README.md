<h2 align="left"> Text </h2>
<p>
 All statements are divided by semicolons Structured Text consists of statements and semicolons to separate them. The language is not case-sensitive Even though it is good practice to use upper- and lowercase for readability, itâ€™s not necessary. Spaces have no function But they should be used for readability.

<h2 align="left"> Calculators </h2>
<p>
    The history of computers goes back over 200 years. At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges.
   The history of computing hardware covers the developments from early simple devices to aid calculation to modern day computers. Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans. Early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations, like the abacus, were referred to as calculating machines or calculators.

     Freddie Williams applied for a patent on his CRT (cathode ray tube) storage device in December. The device that later became known as the Williams tube is capable of storing between 512 and 1024 bits of data. The first hard drive was released by IBM on September 13, 1956.
    Auto, extern, register, static are the four different storage classes in a C program. A storage class specifier in C language is used to define variables, functions, and parameters. auto is used for a local variable defined within a block or function
